# Z-Net POC

A petri-net variation that emulates recursion through acyclic structures and defined hierarchies. Explanation of design are in the slides.pdf file for now, but these are just rough ideas. Was thinking of making some formal definitions, frame rules and proofs - and a better implementation since this is just a POC.

## Done
### Static analysis
- Compile-time deadlock detection

## To-do 
### Runtime
- More testing
- Task-queue based multi-threaded execution
- Perhaps a paper
